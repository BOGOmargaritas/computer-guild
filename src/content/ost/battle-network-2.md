"Bye Mom!" I shouted as I ran out the front door to catch the bus that would take me to my first day at Mega Man Battle Network 2 OST High School. I was SO excited and at that point had only heard the Theme! It was a nervous but short bus ride taking tons of Secret Maneuvers around my Home Town I hadn't really noticed before. It wasnt until the bus pulled into the loop in front of Mega Man Battle Network 2 OST High School, the other kids lazily waddled off the bus and I took my first look at the building that I realized I was actually a framing device. "Great..." I said outloud sitting down in my first class of the day, *...I was just starting to get used to it here* finishing the rest in my head so the cute girl behind me couldnt hear me talking about my embarrassing fourth wall break. The teacher yelled at me for wasting her time and told me to just get on with the review so here it is I guess:</p><p>Just a couple tracks in and I can see about what I'll be getting myself into; lots of noise, fat basses, spacious sprialing synths and beats gallore. First few tracks glide by nice enough with the first real highlight being "At Okuden". There really is nothing like a glittery synth melody with low bit bells polyrhythmically pinging off each ear while dry toms fill each little nook of a song. Well there is something like it and it's a lot of the tracks here while using similar if not the same sounds and tones but that isn't to say none of them stand out. "Begin a Journey" runs through some fun phases with the first to hit sounding almost like mall music from the neon dimension. Im just noticing now that the title is actually "Begin a Journey (Airport)" and yeah, acid dipped airport music just about sums it up. A short run of short, somewhat uneventful tracks later and we reach the creepy back to back tone shifters "Determination in the Heart" and "Suspicious mood" that have me looking over my shoulder as I write this and one of my dogs looking back at me wondering why I dont just suck it up and play the damn game with the rest of the guys. Shut the fuck up Milo.</p><p>"Smoky Field" is fun! I love the way the synth climbs and then resolves into these long notes and arpeggios. Now is a good time to mention the composer Yoshino Aoki and their beautiful use of space in this soundtrack. Fills like snappy synth arpeggios and fat tom rolls are spread wide leaving plenty of space in the middle for heavy beats and catchy melodies. This is perfectly encapsulated by "A Serious Mission" which while not necessarily being my favorite track is certainly the best written, produced and arranged. Thats one of two tracks I had to run back immediately after hearing the second of which being..... "Fear in the Castle"!!! AYOOO we're eating good on this one! Just an unabashed BANGER and one I will be telling people about on the street, at stoplights and on long abandoned internet forums discussing if Bella should stay with Edward or leave to go be with Jacob. Stay with Edward obviously! It sucks to say but we peak with that 2 track run of "A Serious Mission" and "Fear in the Castle" but a couple to note as we wind down are "Internet World" and "Battle Spirit" the latter of which has some really fun stop breaks and jittery fills that elevate that earworm of a main melody.</p><p>The bell rings and I wake up to the sound of shuffling backpacks and allow my eyes to adjust to the fluorescent light on white brick in front of me. I laugh to myself thinking about the dream I just had, knowing it would fade from my memory as most do eventually. Mega Man Battle Network 2 OST High School was real for a moment and that's all that mattered. My skullcandy headphones perfectly unwrap as I take my iPod nano out of my pocket and step into the hallway. Looking down at the tiny screen I see the name of the track, smile and press play. "Peace Again". We made it. Triumph. Tears. Blood, so much blood. Im drowning in blood. And yet a beautiful song washes my skin clean, a siren song for my enemies as they have been dragged limb by limb to their doom and I hold tall the flag of our salvation. Just me. I lived.
