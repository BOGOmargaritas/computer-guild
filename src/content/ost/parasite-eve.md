  The room is dark and a little cramped. Bottles, wires and pieces of paper
  full of furious scribbles litter every surface high and low, and the only
  sign of life is the smoke rising from a small ember nestled in a pipe. The
  eyes it illuminates have seen very little but the ears on either side of
  those eyes have heard the abyss and felt its song. Between those ears is a
  mind that remembers when life was simpler. When all it had to do was think
  of some fun clever wild west jokes, point out some highlights, give a few
  honest jabs at criticism and call it wrapped. A mind that remembers life
  before the Parasite Eve OST.

  When I write these reviews I do a good bit of research on the games and even
  watch some gameplay before sitting down to put words to screen, usually
  after i've heard the OST mind you. I also usually listen to it while I write
  to truly immerse myself in the mood being offered by the music and all these
  factors continue to prove to me how important the music in a game is. This
  fact really shines in a game like Parasite Eve as the mood is already heavy
  and the music adds so much to that weight. The actual listening experience
  was a bit of a rollercoaster though. I'll start with the highs which were
  VERY high. "Theme of Mitochondria" is a lowkey powerhouse of melodic percs
  glued together with a beautifully simple synth line and little glittering
  electronic accents dancing in the peripherals. Almost a techno touch to the
  track. Carrying that techno torch is "Arise Within You" which immediately
  caught my attention as standout tonal shift in the soundtrack up until that
  point. It also gave me slight Monkey Ball vibes which influenced my biased
  love greatly and might have possibly maybe caused a Monkey Ball break in the
  middle of listening, I am just a man. "Out of Phase" slows things down a bit
  in tempo but ramps things up in layers and structure with a crispy snare
  line and watery wood melody giving an almost jungle feel to this otherwise
  urban setting.

  The moments that stick to a simple piano line and heavy atmosphere like the
  "Memory" tracks or "Wheel of Fortune" carry my interest no matter how long
  they run however the strongest emotional reaction I had throughout the
  entire runtime was to "Kyrie". What a beautifully arranged track from the
  composer of this downward spiral of a soundtrack Yoko Shimomura. She is
  probably best known for her work on the Kingdom Hearts series but Parasite
  Eve appears to be her real breakout on the game music scene despite having
  also worked on Super Mario RPG two years prior. Shimomura opens the doors to
  the cathedral on "Kyrie" and walks you down the black aisle to what sounds
  like your doom while haunting vocal synthesis reminds you its not just
  spirits in attendance. This "voice" is used frequently throughout the
  tracklist sometimes to its detriment, and while that remained my opinion
  throughout I did grow more accustomed to it as its appearances increased. I
  believe its the one ingredient that aged the poorest out of all the ideas
  here and I, myself, almost spontaneously combusted a few times early on when
  it vibrated onto the mix.

  Deeper into the rabbit hole the horror seems to give way to some more dark
  deep techno jams, my personal favorite of this stretch being "U.B" with its
  rythmic chants and organ arpeggios. Even the criminally short "Escape From
  U.B" goes just a bit crazier than it needed to and I had to stand up to
  really feel that one out (had to run it back a few times too). The one and
  only fully produced vocal track "Somnia Memorias" rounds the whole
  experience out near the end of what feels like all things, soulfully sung
  with some surprisingly rocking guitars riffing throughout. In full the
  entire listening experience is very eclectic spanning an array of dark,
  moody jams with a wild and industrial twist that still feels very natural in
  execution. Having been to NYC multiple times I can confirm this is what
  plays on the train as you near the city and things start to get a little
  hot.
