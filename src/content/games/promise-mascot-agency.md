When I was younger, I had a particular view on what ‘cool’ meant. I tried so hard in high school to fit in with a group of kids that I considered ‘cool’ at the time and never really made it into their friend group. They couldn’t relate to the 20 year-old video games I played and talked about, so they kinda kept me on the outside because of it. The friendship just wasn’t meant to be! I recognized the fact that these kids were rejecting me (in part) because I was maybe a little too interested in old video games that none of them cared about, so I slowly started to distance myself from my favorite hobby. Time went on, I went off to college trying to be a ‘cool, normal guy who wasn’t hyper-fixated on video games’. That worked for me for a while, but a roommate convinced me to try a new game he had just bought for his ps3 (FarCry 3) and I was hooked! The difference this time, was that my girlfriend (now wife), Libby didn’t seem repulsed by the fact that I was playing a video game — in fact, she was enjoying watching me and following the story of it. I started to meet more people at college and in the surrounding city that weren’t always interested in video games, but enjoyed the fact that I was passionate and enthusiastic about them. Over time, these friendships turned into strong bonds with some of my closest friends today. When I picture all my friends now, I realize I really didn’t know what ‘cool’ was back then, because it is clear to see they couldn’t be more different from that group of kids in high school and I wouldn’t have it any other way.<br>

Promise Mascot Agency is a management ‘sim’ where the player controls a disgraced yakuza (Michi) attempting to pay back his debts by running a mascot agency (Promise Mascot Agency (PMA)). The game is a mix of Yakuza, Pokemon, Zoo Tycoon, and a municipal tourism brochure. In this world, mascots aren’t just people in suits—they’re sentient creatures, ranging from a sushi roll cat to a moss ball to a severed pinky finger like Michi’s companion, “Pinky”.<br><br>

Throughout the game, the player drives around a small Japanese town called Kaso-Machi in a Kei Truck with their companion, Pinky riding in the truck bed. The goal is to build a successful business out of the mascot agency. To do so, Michi must find mascots in town that are willing to work for the agency as well as local business owners who are somehow cool with being represented by a bipedal sea cucumber.<br><br>

Gameplay involves negotiating contracts with mascots: you'll haggle over wages, vacation days, and performance bonuses like you’re running HR for a circus. Each mascot has stats and energy levels, so you’ll need to match them to the right gig—send a hyperactive bunny to hype a nightclub, not sweep a ramen shop. When they’re tired, let them rest. Even moss balls need self-care.<br>

As Michi explores Kaso-Machi, he’ll come across locals who are willing to step in as "heroes"—everyday folks with just enough free time (and flair) to assist a struggling mascot. While your mascots are out on the job, they might run into unexpected problems: maybe a stack of boxes is blocking their path, a vending machine won’t cooperate, or they face off against their natural enemy—uneven pavement. When that happens, you can choose to send in a hero to save the day. This triggers a quick minigame where you play hero cards to overcome the obstacle and keep your mascot on track. Each hero brings their own personality and abilities to the table, making them a fun and surprisingly useful part of your growing support team.<br><br>

Along the way, Michi tries to clean up the town of Kaso-Machi (literally) while also rebuilding his own reputation, one mascot-fueled job at a time. What starts as a desperate hustle to pay off debts slowly transforms into something more meaningful, as Michi connects with the community and begins to take pride in his strange new role. There’s an oddly heartfelt undercurrent to all the absurdity—beneath the layers of pinky jokes, sentient sushi rolls, and moss-based employment is a surprisingly touching story about redemption, second chances, and the healing power of costumed weirdos who just want to make the world a little brighter.<br><br>

Playing Promise Mascot Agency had me thinking about my own group of friends —- none of whom are the people I imagined I’d hang out with as an adult. They’re all wildly different, and on paper, we probably shouldn’t get along. But somehow, all those quirks and odd passions blend together into a weird little friendship soup that's chaotic, creative, and way more fun than it has any right to be. Much like the mascots in the game, it’s not about fitting a mold -— it’s about showing up as your weird, wonderful self and finding the people who get it.<br><br>
